### Final Project: Coral Bleaching Temperature Thresholds ###   
##### Willa Rowan #####   
   
I am interested in analyzing how often sea surface temperatures in a coral reef exceed the 'bleaching threshold', or the temperature above which corals begin to die.   
I am specifically interested in seeing how bleaching event occurences may have changed in frequency and severity over the period of record, as climate change warms oceans.   
I will use temperature data from NOAA, published through their [Coral Reef Watch](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/vs/timeseries/polynesia.php#southern_tonga). I have specified Southern Tonga as my study area and am using the [timeseries data](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/vs/data/southern_tonga.txt), which comes as a text file. I am cleaning it up in Excel and will upload a csv file to my GitHub final project repo to accompany my Python script.   
For processing data, I will need to filter out only the temperature readings that exceed the published bleaching threshold, still keeping them attached to their time data. I may perform some simple statistics to see how much bleaching occurrences have changed through time.      
I then plan to visualize these results using matplotlib, indicating any patterns in frequency or intensity of bleaching events through time.   
I'll learn how to do some fancy visualization with matplotlib, as well as subsetting datasets.
